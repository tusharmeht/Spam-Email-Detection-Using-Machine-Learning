This repository contains a project focused on detecting spam emails using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content and metadata. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Different machine learning techniques, including supervised learning algorithms, are explored and compared to determine the most effective approach for spam detection. This project serves as a practical implementation of machine learning concepts and can be a valuable reference for anyone interested in natural language processing and classification tasks.
